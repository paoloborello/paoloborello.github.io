I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yixin Wang](https://yixinwang.github.io/). Before joining Michigan, I earned an M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science and a B.Sc. in Mathematics for Finance and Insurance from the [University of Torino](https://www.unito.it/), where I worked with [Prof. Stefano Favaro](https://sites.carloalberto.org/favaro/) on deep learning theory. I also completed a Master in Economics at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/).

My research interests center on **Causal Inference** and **Generative AI**. In particular, I am working on finite-sample methods for causal discovery and on representation learning with diffusion models.

As a Graduate Student Instructor, I was honored to receive the [Rackham Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award](https://rackham.umich.edu/faculty-and-staff/awards/outstanding-graduate-student-instructor-awards/), which recognizes exceptional teaching at the University of Michigan.
