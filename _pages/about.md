I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I was born and raised in Torino, Italy. I previously graduated from the [University of Torino](https://www.unito.it/) with a B.Sc. in Mathematics for Finance and Insurance and an M.Sc. in Stochastics and Data Science, and from [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/) with a Master in Statistics and Applied Mathematics. 

Besides working on my research,  I'm a fan of catching both types of football. I also enjoy going to the gym, and I would like to pick up triathlon to run a full IronMan in a couple of years.
